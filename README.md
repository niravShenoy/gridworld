# gridworld
A project to understand the concepts of Reinforcement Learning using the Gridworld environment

## Goal of the project
Implement different reinforcement learning algorithms to show their success in solving the Gridworld problem.
The approach is to first test the algorithm against an environment in OpenAI gym and then extend it to the base Gridworld environment.
